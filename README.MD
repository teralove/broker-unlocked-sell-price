# Broker Unlocked Sell Price

- One solution for when you can't list items higher than the average broker price when using S1UI mods.

## Note

- Updating your S1UI mods should fix the broker listing problem, so this script shouldn't be needed. But it's here just in case.
- Requires [S_TRADE_BROKER_INPUT_PRICE](https://github.com/teralove/mm-guide/blob/master/S_TRADE_BROKER_INPUT_PRICE.1.def), put it in tera-proxy/node_modules/tera-data/protocol
